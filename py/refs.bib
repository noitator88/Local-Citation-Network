Existing theories, however, are restricted to either weakly coupled nanostructures or phase-coherent transport in mesoscopic conductors. Here, we consider an interacting quantum dot and develop a real-time diagrammatic theory of waiting time distributions that can treat the interesting regime, in which both interaction effects and higher-order tunneling processes are important. Specifically, we find that our quantum-mechanical theory captures higher-order tunneling processes at low temperatures, which are not included in a classical description, and which dramatically affect the waiting times by allowing fast tunneling processes inside the Coulomb blockade region. Our work paves the way for systematic investigations of temporal fluctuations in interacting quantum systems, for example close to a Kondo resonance or in a Luttinger liquid.},

Recently, theories of electron waiting times have been devised for quantum transport in Coulomb-blockade structures and for mesoscopic conductors, however, so far a proper description of a detector has been missing. Here we develop a quantum theory of a waiting time clock capable of measuring the distribution of waiting times between electrons above the Fermi sea in a mesoscopic conductor. The detector consists of a mesoscopic capacitor coupled to a quantum two-level system whose coherent precession we monitor. Under ideal operating conditions our waiting time clock recovers the results of earlier theories without a detector. We investigate possible deviations due to an imperfect waiting time clock.

We illustrate our methodology by calculating the waiting time distribution for a quantum point contact and find a cross-over from Wigner-Dyson statistics at full transmission to Poisson statistics close to pinch-off.

Experimentally, the waiting time distributions can be measured using real-time single-electron detectors in the regime of slow tunneling, where conventional current measurements are demanding.

The zero-frequency full counting statistics, on the other hand, is independent of the aforementioned quantities, thus giving no insight into the internal dynamics. The fact that the waiting time distribution and the zero-frequency full counting statistics give a non-equivalent information is associated with two factors. Firstly, it can be explained by the sensitivity to different timescales of the dynamics of the system. Secondly, it is associated with the presence of the correlation between subsequent waiting times, which makes the renewal theory, relating the full counting statistics and the waiting time distribution, not longer applicable. The study highlights the particular usefulness of the waiting time distribution for the analysis of the internal dynamics of mesoscopic systems.},

We study waiting time distribution for quantum transport in a vibrating molecular junction. By treating the electron-vibration interaction exactly and molecule-electrode coupling perturbatively, we obtain master equation and compute the distribution of waiting times for electron transport. The details of waiting time distributions are used to elucidate microscopic mechanism of electron transport and the role of electron-vibration interactions. We find that as nonequilibrium develops in molecular junction, the skewness and dispersion of the waiting time distribution experience stepwise drops with the increase of the electric current. These steps are associated with the excitations of vibrational states by tunnelling electrons. In the strong electron-vibration coupling regime, the dispersion decrease dominates over all other changes in the waiting time distribution as the molecular junction departs far away from the equilibrium.},

The waiting time distributions are evaluated at low temperatures for square-wave and harmonic driving protocols. In the adiabatic regime, the dynamics of the turnstile is synchronized with the external drive. As the non-adiabatic regime is approached, the waiting time distribution becomes dominated by cycle-missing events in which the turnstile fails to emit within one or several periods.

  abstract      = {In the resonant tunneling regime sequential processes dominate single electron transport through quantum dots or molecules that are weakly coupled to macroscopic electrodes. In the Coulomb blockade regime, however, cotunneling processes dominate. Cotunneling is an inherently quantum phenomenon and thus gives rise to interesting observations, such as an increase in the current shot noise. Since cotunneling processes are inherently fast compared to the sequential processes, it is of interest to examine the short time behaviour of systems where cotunneling plays a role, and whether these systems display nonrenewal statistics. We consider three questions in this paper. Given that an electron has tunneled from the source to the drain via a cotunneling or sequential process, what is the waiting time until another electron cotunnels from the source to the drain? What are the statistical properties of these waiting time intervals? How does cotunneling affect the statistical properties of a system with strong inelastic electron-electron interactions? In answering these questions, we extend the existing formalism for waiting time distributions in single electron transport to include cotunneling processes via an $n$-resolved Markovian master equation. We demonstrate that for a single resonant level the analytic waiting time distribution including cotunneling processes yields information on individual tunneling amplitudes. For both a SRL and an Anderson impurity deep in the Coulomb blockade there is a nonzero probability for two electrons to cotunnel to the drain with zero waiting time inbetween. Furthermore, we show that at high voltages cotunneling processes slightly modify the nonrenewal behaviour of an Anderson impurity with a strong inelastic electron-electron interaction.},

We express the generating function of full counting statistics using Keldysh non-equilibrium Green's functions formalism. Our analysis goes beyond the wideband approximation and is suitable for first principles calculation on realistic systems. Analytic solution has been obtained for short and long time behaviors of waiting times. At short times, the WTD shows a linear dependence on the waiting time while in the long time limit, WTD follows Poisson distribution. We have applied this theory to a quantum dot connected by two leads and calculated cumulants of transferred charge as well as WTD in the transient regime.

  abstract      = {The waiting time distribution (WTD) is a common tool for analysing discrete stochastic processes in classical and quantum systems. However, there are many physical examples where the dynamics is continuous and only approximately discrete, or where it is favourable to discuss the dynamics on a discretized and a continuous level in parallel. An example is the hindered motion of particles through potential landscapes with barriers. In the present paper we propose a consistent generalisation of the WTD from the discrete case to situations where the particles perform continuous barrier-crossing characterised by a finite duration. To this end, we introduce a recipe to calculate the WTD from the Fokker-Planck/Smoluchowski equation. In contrast to the closely related first passage time distribution (FPTD), which is frequently used to describe continuous processes, the WTD contains information about the direction of motion. As an application, we consider the paradigmatic example of an overdamped particle diffusing through a washboard potential. To verify the approach and to elucidate its numerical implications, we compare the WTD defined via the Smoluchowski equation with data from direct simulation of the underlying Langevin equation and find full consistency provided that the jumps in the Langevin approach are defined properly. Moreover, for sufficiently large energy barriers, the WTD defined via the Smoluchowski equation becomes consistent with that resulting from the analytical solution of a (two-state) master equation model for the short-time dynamics developed previous by us [PRE 86, 061135 (2012)]. Thus, our approach "interpolates" between these two types of stochastic motion. We illustrate our approach for both symmetric systems and systems under constant force.},

For this purpose we adapt a recently introduced diagrammatic approach to the time domain. The generating function for the time-dependent charge transfer probabilities is evaluated numerically by discretizing the Keldysh contour. The method allows us to analyze the system evolution to the steady state after a sudden connection of the dot to the leads, starting from different initial conditions. Simple analytical results are obtained in the regime of very short times. We study in particular the apparent bistable behavior occurring for strong electron-phonon coupling, small bias voltages and a detuned dot level. The results obtained are in remarkable good agreement with numerically exact results obtained by Quantum Monte Carlo methods. We analyze the waiting time distribution and charge transfer probabilities, showing that only a single electron transfer is responsible for the rich structure found in the short times regime. A universal scaling (independent of the model parameters) is found for the relative amplitude of the higher order current cumulants in the short times regime, starting from an initially empty dot. We finally analyze the convergence to the steady state of the differential conductance and of the differential Fano factor at the inelastic threshold, which exhibits a peculiar oscillatory behavior.},

As the degree of overlap between the electronic wave functions is tuned, the WTD reveals how the correlations between particles are modified. In the weak overlap regime, the WTD is made of several equidistant peaks, separated by the same period as the incoming pulses, contained in an almost exponentially decaying envelope. In the other limit, the WTD of a single quantum channel subjected to a constant voltage is recovered. In both cases, the WTD stresses the difference between the fluctuations induced by the scatterer and the ones encoded in the incoming quantum state. A clear cross-over between these two situations is studied with numerical and analytical calculations based on scattering theory.},

We define the tunnelling time distribution for quantum processes in a dissipative environment and develop a practical approach for calculating it, where the environment is described by the general Markovian master equation. We illustrate the theory by using the rate equation to compute the tunnelling time distribution for electron transport through a molecular junction. The tunnelling time distribution is exponential, which indicates that Markovian quantum tunnelling is a Poissonian statistical process. The tunnelling time distribution is used not only to study the quantum statistics of tunnelling along the average electric current but also to analyse extreme quantum events where an electron jumps against the applied voltage bias. The average tunnelling time shows distinctly different temperature dependance for p- and n-type molecular junction and therefore provides a sensitive tool to probe the alignment of molecular orbitals relative to the electrode Fermi energy.},

For small energy separation the electrons in the quantum dots delocalize and form molecular states. In this regime we establish the experimental equivalence between cotunneling and sequential tunneling into molecular states for electron transport in a double quantum dot. Finally, we investigate inelastic cotunneling processes involving excited states of the quantum dots.

Splitting of Cooper pairs from a superconductor provides entangled electrons at separate locations. However, experimentally accessing the individual split Cooper pairs constitutes a major unresolved issue as they mix together with electrons from competing processes. Here, we overcome this challenge with the first real-time observation of the splitting of individual Cooper pairs, enabling direct access to the time-resolved statistics of Cooper pair splitting. We determine the correlation statistics arising from two-electron processes and find a pronounced peak that is two orders of magnitude larger than the background. Our experiment thereby allows to unambiguously pinpoint and select split Cooper pairs with 99 % fidelity. These results open up an avenue for performing experiments that tap into the spin-entanglement of split Cooper pairs.},

Here, quantum dots have proven to be well suited systems, as they exhibit both single photon emission and single electron charge transport. While single photon emission is generally studied on self-assembled quantum dots, single electron transport studies are focused on gate-defined structures. We investigate, on a single self-assembled quantum dot, the single electron transport in the optical telegraph signal with high bandwidth and observe in the full counting statistics the interplay between charge and spin dynamics in a noninvasive way.

The emphasis is put on the analysis of the current cross-correlations between the currents flowing through the left and right arms of the device and relevant electron waiting time distributions. We show that both quantities can give an important insight into the subgap transport processes and their analysis can help optimizing the system parameters for achieving the considerable Andreev current and efficient Cooper pair splitting. Strong positive values of cross-correlations are associated with the presence of tunneling processes enhancing the Cooper pair splitting efficiency, while short waiting times for electrons tunneling through distinct ferromagnetic contacts indicate fast splitting of emitted Cooper pairs. In particular, we study two detuning schemes and show that antisymmetric shift of side quantum dots energy levels is favorable for efficient Cooper pair splitting. The analysis of spin-resolved waiting time distributions supports the performance enhancement due to the presence of ferromagnetic contacts, which is in particular revealed for short times. Finally, we consider the effect of changing the inter-dot hopping amplitude and predict that strong inter-dot correlations lead to a reduction of Andreev transport properties in low-bias limit.},

The AB effect leads to a non-monotonic dependence of the steady-state current on the gauge phase associated with the molecular ring. This dependence is sensitive to site energy, temperature, and dephasing, and can be explained using the concept of the dark state. Although the phase effect vanishes in the steady-state current for strong dephasing, the phase dependence remains visible in an associated waiting-time distribution, especially at short times. Interestingly, the phase rigidity (i.e., the symmetry of the AB phase) observed in the steady-state current is now broken in the waiting-time statistics, which can be explained by the interference between transfer pathways.},

In an alternative approach, the distribution of the first-passage times, i.e. the time delays after which the counting variable reaches a certain threshold value, is studied. This paper presents the approach to calculate the first-passage time distribution in systems in which the analyzed current is associated with an arbitrary set of transitions within the Markovian network. Using this approach it is shown that when the subsequent first-passage times are uncorrelated there exist strict relations between the cumulants of the full counting statistics and the first-passage time distribution. On the other hand, when the correlations of the first-passage times are present, their distribution may provide additional information about the internal dynamics of the system in comparison to the full counting statistics; for example, it may reveal the switching between different dynamical states of the system. Additionally, I show that breaking of the fluctuation theorem for first-passage times may reveal the multicyclic nature of the Markovian network.},

To go beyond this, we propose a spread-spectrum approach where electron flying qubits are injected in a non-periodic manner following a pseudorandom binary bit pattern. Extending the Floquet scattering theory approach from periodic to spread-spectrum drive, the shot noise of pseudorandom binary sequences of single electron injection can be calculated for leviton and non-leviton sources. Our new approach allows us to disentangle the physics of the manipulated excitations from that of the injection protocol. In particular, the spread spectrum approach is shown to provide a better knowledge of electronic Hong Ou Mandel correlations and to clarify the nature of the pulse train coherence and the role of the dynamical orthogonality catastrophe for non-integer charge injection.},

  abstract      = {It is well-known that Lorentzian voltage pulses with integer quantum flux can lead to noiseless current in quantum conductors. The current is carried by charged quasiparticles in the Fermi sea of the conductors, which have well-defined wave functions and have been named as "levitons". However, it is not clear how levitons evolve as the flux of the pulses changes continuously toward a fractional value. To answer this question, we introduce a set of Wannier-like single-body wave functions, which can be used to describe the quantum states of the quasiparticles injected by Lorentzian pulses with arbitrary flux. We show that, by tuning the flux of the pulses, levitons can evolve into quasiparticles carrying fractional charges. In the meantime, additional fractional-charged quasiparticles can also be excited, which can form neutral electron-hole pairs. The information of these quasiparticles can be extracted from the shot noise of the current. These knowledge can be helpful for the time-resolved quantum control of propagating electrons in solid-state circuits.},

The many-body state is expressed manifestly in terms of single-electron and electron-hole quasiparticle excitations with the amplitudes and probabilities of creation which depend on the details of the applied voltage. We experimentally probe the time dependence of the constituent electronic states by using an analog of the optical Hong-Ou-Mandel correlation experiment where electrons emitted from the terminals with a relative time delay collide at the contact. The electron wave packet overlap is directly related to the current noise power in the contact. We have confirmed the time dependence of the electronic states predicted theoretically by measurements of the current noise power in a tunnel junction under harmonic excitation.},

  abstract      = {Recent developments in the coherent manipulation of electrons in ballistic conductors include the generation of time-periodic electrical currents involving one to few electronic excitations per period. However, using individual electrons as carrier of quantum information for flying qubit computation or quantum metrology applications calls for a general method to unravel the single-particle excitations embedded in a quantum electrical current and how quantum information is encoded within it. Here, we propose a general signal processing algorithm to extract the elementary single-particle states, called electronic atoms of signal, present in any periodic quantum electrical current. These excitations and their mutual quantum coherence describe the excess single-electron coherence in the same way musical notes and score describe a sound signal emitted by a music instrument. This method, which is the first step towards the development of signal processing of quantum electrical currents is illustrated by assessing the quality of experimentally relevant single electron sources. The example of randomized quantum electrical currents obtained by regularly clocked but randomly injected unit charge Lorentzian voltage pulses enables us to discuss how interplay of the coherence of the applied voltage and of the Pauli principle alter the quantum coherence between the emitted single particle excitations.},

We study the effects of modifying the shape of the voltage waveform that drives the electron pump, and show that our results can be explained by a tunneling model of the emission mechanism.

Two-particle correlations appear as a consequence of erasing of which path information due to collisions taking place at distant interferometers and in general at different times. The two-particle correlations manifest themselves as an Aharonov-Bohm effect in noise while the current is insensitive to magnetic fluxes. In an appropriate time-interval the concurrence reaches a maximum and a Bell inequality is violated.},

  abstract      = {To analyze the state of injected carrier streams of different electron sources, we propose to use correlation measurements at a quantum point contact with the different sources connected via chiral edge states to the two inputs. In particular we consider the case of an on-demand single-electron emitter correlated with the carriers incident from a biased normal reservoir, a contact subject to an alternating voltage and a stochastic single electron emitter. The correlation can be viewed as a spectroscopic tool to compare the states of injected particles of different sources. If at the quantum point contact the amplitude profiles of electrons overlap, the noise correlation is suppressed. In the absence of an overlap the noise is roughly the sum of the noise powers due to the electron streams in each input. We show that the electron state emitted from a (dc or ac) biased metallic contact is different from a Lorentzian amplitude electron state emitted by the single electron emitter (a quantum capacitor driven with slow harmonic potential), since with these inputs the noise correlation is not suppressed. In contrast, if quantized voltage pulses are applied to a metallic contact instead of a dc (ac) bias then the noise can be suppressed. We find a noise suppression for multi-electron pulses and for the case of stochastic electron emitters for which the appearance of an electron at the quantum point contact is probabilistic.},

We present a review of this development focusing on shot noise in small electric conductors. Shot noise is a consequence of the quantization of charge. It can be used to obtain information on a system which is not available through conductance measurements. In particular, shot noise experiments can determine the charge and statistics of the quasiparticles relevant for transport, and reveal information on the potential profile and internal energy scales of mesoscopic systems. Shot noise is generally more sensitive to the effects of electron-electron interactions than the average conductance. We present a discussion based on the conceptually transparent scattering approach and on the classical Langevin and Boltzmann-Langevin methods; in addition a discussion of results which cannot be obtained by these methods is provided. We conclude the review by pointing out a number of unsolved problems and an outlook on the likely future development of the field.},

It involves an idealized scheme of current measurement using a spin 1/2 coupled to the current so that it precesses at the rate proportional to the current. Within such an approach, counting charge without breaking the circuit is possible. As an application, we derive the counting statistics in a single channel conductor at finite temperature and bias. For a perfectly transmitting channel the counting distribution is gaussian, both for zero-point fluctuations and at finite temperature. At constant bias and low temperature the distribution is binomial, i.e., it arises from Bernoulli statistics. Another application considered is the noise due to short current pulses that involve few electrons. We find the time-dependence of the driving potential that produces coherent noise-minimizing current pulses, and display analogies of such current states with quantum-mechanical coherent states.},

Lorentzian-shaped voltage pulses are of particular interest as they lead to the emission of clean single-particle excitations as recently demonstrated experimentally.
