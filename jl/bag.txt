                     We solve the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations for aclean, one-dimensional superconductor in the
                   presence of super6uid Bow. The maximum electrical current occurs when the super8uid velocity v,
                   equals the Landau depairing velocity B/pF, where 4is the pairing potential of the superconductor
                   and pF is the Fermi momentum.  The resulting critical current is approximately 2/s times smaller
                   than the value eb/5 recently predicted for asuperconducting  point contact. The "discretized"
                   critical current of (2/s)(eE/5) arises when all the conducting electrons are forced to drift at the
                   Landau depairing velocity.
